# Auth / token

Ask admins for token. Gateway uses JWT for generating token with special permissions: rate limit for every endpoint in particular.

You need to provide expected peak RPS.

**DO NOT USE TEST TOKENS EXCEPT WHEN YOU ARE DOING MANUAL TESTING**

you can find test tokens here [https://github.com/mynalabsai/gateway/tree/master/json](https://github.com/mynalabsai/gateway/tree/master/json)
